# lita-reminder

# Work in progress - partially usable yet buggy

This is an effort to add an advanced task scheduler to lita bot. 
It is currenly in early development but partially usable as-is, but it might be
pretty buggy as of now.

Supports in, at, every and cron-like tasks. Uses Rufus-scheduler and Chronic.

Planned: domain expiration notification
